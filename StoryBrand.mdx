# StoryBrand Framework: Startup Builder

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Technical Founder, AI Builder, or Solopreneur who wants to launch startups at the speed of thought.

**What do they want?**

- Launch complete startups in hours, not months
- Define business logic as code that AI agents can execute
- Have every component—site, app, API, docs—generated and deployed automatically
- Focus on strategy while automation handles execution

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)

"Building a startup requires assembling dozens of tools, services, and platforms—and integrating them all takes months."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)

"I have great ideas but not enough time or resources to execute them all. Every startup requires the same tedious setup work."

### Philosophical Problem

In the age of AI, building a startup should be as simple as describing what you want. The technology exists—it just needs to be unified.

### The Villain

**Fragmentation & Manual Labor** — The endless patchwork of disconnected tools, manual configurations, and repetitive setup tasks that slow down innovation and drain founder energy.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built the infrastructure that lets AI agents construct complete startups from business definitions.

**Empathy:** We've launched multiple startups ourselves and felt the pain of rebuilding the same components over and over.

**Authority:**

- Built on battle-tested primitives from primitives.org.ai
- Powers the Startups.Studio portfolio
- Integrates with industry-standard tools and platforms
- Backed by a comprehensive business ontology from business.org.ai

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Define Your ICP

Select your Ideal Customer Profile from our business ontologies. Define who you're building for with structured data.

```typescript
import { Startup } from 'startup-builder'

const startup = Startup.create({
  icp: 'technical-founders',
  industry: 'developer-tools',
  problem: 'Building startups is too slow'
})
```

### Step 2: Specify Products & Services

Define what you're offering—SaaS, API, marketplace, or service business—with Business-as-Code primitives.

```typescript
startup.addProduct({
  type: 'saas',
  name: 'AutoLaunch',
  features: ['instant-deploy', 'ai-content', 'analytics']
})
```

### Step 3: Generate & Deploy

Let the builder create your Site, App, API, CLI, MCP, SDK, Docs, and Blog automatically.

```typescript
await startup.build({
  site: true,
  app: true,
  api: true,
  cli: true,
  mcp: true,
  sdk: true,
  docs: true,
  blog: true
})
```

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Start Building → `npx startup-builder init`

**Transitional CTA:** Explore the API at api.sb

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**

- Launch a complete startup in a single afternoon
- Every component professionally generated and deployed
- AI agents managing ongoing operations
- Scale from idea to revenue without hiring a team
- Build a portfolio of autonomous startups

**Transformation:**

From: Spending months on setup and configuration
To: Describing your business and watching it come to life

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**

- Spending months building boilerplate before reaching product-market fit
- Ideas dying in the "setup phase" before they ever launch
- Burning out from repetitive tasks across multiple ventures
- Losing competitive advantage while competitors ship faster

## 8. Brand Identity

**Voice:** Technical yet accessible, ambitious, builder-focused

**Tone:** Empowering, efficient, future-forward

**Key Messages:**

1. "Business-as-Code. Startups-as-Infrastructure."
2. "Define your business. We build the rest."
3. "Launch autonomous startups at the speed of thought."

## 10. Messaging by Audience

### For Technical Founders

"Stop rebuilding infrastructure. Define your business in code and let AI agents handle Site, App, API, CLI, MCP, SDK, Docs, and Blog generation. Ship startups in hours."

### For AI Builders

"Build on a unified API at api.sb with persistent state at db.sb. Use primitives.org.ai abstractions to create startups that AI agents can operate autonomously."

### For Studio Operators

"Run a portfolio of autonomous startups. Each one defined as code, operated by agents, scaled independently. Multiply your throughput without multiplying headcount."

### For Investors

"Back founders who can 10x their output. Startup Builder enables rapid iteration, parallel ventures, and AI-native operations from day one."
