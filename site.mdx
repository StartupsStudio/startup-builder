## Problem

<Section variant="problem">

### The Old Way is Broken

Building a startup used to mean:

- **Months of setup** before writing any product code
- **Dozens of tools** that don't talk to each other
- **Repetitive work** for every new venture
- **Manual operations** that don't scale

Every founder rebuilds the same infrastructure. Every startup reinvents the same wheel.

</Section>

## Solution

<Section variant="solution">

### Business-as-Code Changes Everything

```typescript
const startup = Startup.create({
  name: 'AutoLaunch',
  icp: 'technical-founders',
  problem: 'Building startups takes too long'
})

await startup.build({
  site: true,
  app: true,
  api: true,
  docs: true
})

// That's it. You're live.
```

Define your business logic. We generate everything else.

## FAQ

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "What exactly gets generated?",
      answer: "Startup Builder generates production-ready code for your Site (Next.js), App (full-stack with auth), API (REST/GraphQL), CLI (Node.js), MCP server, SDKs (TypeScript/Python/Go), Docs site, and Blog. Everything is customizable after generation."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the Business-as-Code approach work?",
      answer: "You define your business using structured primitives—ICP, products, services, pricing, features. The builder interprets these definitions and generates appropriate code for each build target. It's like infrastructure-as-code, but for entire businesses."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the generated code?",
      answer: "Absolutely. All generated code is yours to modify. We use standard frameworks (Next.js, Hono, etc.) so you can extend and customize everything."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between api.sb and db.sb?",
      answer: "api.sb handles actions, events, and integrations—the 'doing' layer. db.sb handles persistent user and tenant data—the 'storing' layer. Together they provide a complete backend for autonomous startup operations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI agents operate my startup?",
      answer: "Yes! The MCP server generation means AI agents can interact with your startup natively. Combined with primitives.org.ai abstractions, you can build fully autonomous operations."
